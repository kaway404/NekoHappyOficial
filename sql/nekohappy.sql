From tropical Adriatic settings to dazzling aerial maneuvers, this action-adventure from world-renowned animator Hayao Miyazaki is full of humor, courage and chivalry. When \"Porco\" —whose face has been transformed into that of a pig by a mysterious spell— infuriates a band of sky pirates with his aerial heroics, the pirates hire Curtis, a rival pilot, to \"get rid\" of him. On the ground, the two pilots compete for the affections of the beautiful Gina. But it is in the air where the true battles are waged. Will our hero be victorious? n(Source: Disney)', 'awEC-aLDzjs', '2013-02-20 19:06:14', '2016-07-04 03:01:41', '753498_1308739472730_full.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 638049, '2014-11-21 00:08:37', 4.0459326799453, 5865, 'Children', 5, '1992-07-18', '0000-00-00', 0, '380.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 0, 2014, 282, 0, 0, 'en', 'N', 39391),

Of course, there\'s also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines. nOne day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the \"BlackBird\"). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car\'s previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner\'s death. The manga follows Akio\'s various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority. n(Source: AniDB)', 'N', '2013-02-20 19:37:17', '2016-07-04 03:03:18', 'N', 'N', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 3.7402443035101647, 606, 'Teens 13 or older', 1, '2007-06-15', '2008-09-13', 0, '2372.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 0, 2014, 0, 0, 0, 'en_jp', 'N', 33061),

The Petit Eva project has also developed merchandising from super-deformed figurines to limited edition Doritos corn chips.\"rn(Source: MoonPhase)', 'N', '2013-02-20 19:53:32', '2016-07-04 03:04:07', 'N', 'N', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 2.7571269660319784, 1201, 'Children', 4, '2007-03-20', '2009-03-11', 0, '3481.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 0, 2014, 0, 0, 0, 'en_jp', 'N', 57046),

However, when he\'s forbidden to reveal the truth, Lag is soon forced out of the artificial sunlight and back into the world of perpetual night. And soon Reverse\'s plot to take down the Letter Bees and overthrow the Amberground government begins to accelerate. If things weren\'t already bad enough, the giant insect creatures called gaichuu are apparently evolving into something new; there may be traitors working within the Hive; and Niche\'s sister, who\'s definitely not human friendly, shows up to turn family drama into a full-scale siege! It all spells serious trouble for the Letter Bees, but if anyone can weather the storms and gloom of night, Lag and his team are the ones who\'ll deliver.nn(Source: FUNimation)', '', '2013-02-20 20:21:20', '2016-07-04 03:05:20', '85c022161b.png', 'image/png', 683918, '2014-12-08 16:52:02', 3.9131176967241963, 2301, 'Teens 13 or older', 1, '2010-10-03', '2011-03-26', 0, '101926357238.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 0, 2016, 0, 0, 0, 'en', 'N', 382551),

Her father was killed in the war and her mother travels constantly, so in addition to attending high school, Umi must also run the family business. Her classmate Shun, an orphan unsure of his lineage, lives with a few other students in the old high-school clubhouse, a French-style, mansion that\'s set to be demolished as part of the current modernization project. Shun and his schoolmates refuse to let this happen. nAs much as they fear losing their shelter, they are also appalled at what they see as the erasure of their history. As the students organize a protest, Shun and Umi grow closer. What begins as a friendship develops into something deeper as these two lonely teenagers find a mutual understanding and trust. Yet when Shun starts to investigate his past, secrets emerge that threaten to tear the two apart. n(Source: Toronto International Film Festival)', 'k-vfzhfq5JA', '2013-02-20 20:32:46', '2016-07-04 03:05:48', 'poppyhill.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 264433, '2014-11-29 00:16:52', 3.9872178815038266, 4432, 'Children', 5, '2011-07-16', '0000-00-00', 0, '6000.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 0, 2014, 200, 0, 0, 'en', 'N', 31624),

The War of the Holy Grail is a contest in which seven magi summon seven Heroic Spirits to compete to obtain the power of the \"Holy Grail,\" which grants a miracle. After three inconclusive wars for the elusive Holy Grail, the Fourth War commences.nnFounded by the Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka families centuries ago, the Einzbern family is determined to achieve success after three successive failures, no matter the cost. As a result, they have elected to bring the hated magus killer, Kiritsugu Emiya, into their ranks, despite his methods and reputation as a skilled mercenary and a hitman who employs whatever he can use to accomplish his goals. Though Kiritsugu had once wanted to become a hero who could save everyone, he has long since abandoned this ideal upon realizing that saving one person comes at the cost of another\'s life. For the sake of humanity, he will ruthlessly destroy anything and anyone who threatens the peace of others.nnHowever, Kiritsugu finds himself deeply torn between the love he has found for his new family—his wife Irisviel and their daughter Illya—and what he must do to obtain the Holy Grail. Meanwhile, Kiritsugu\'s greatest opponent appears in the form of Kirei Kotomine, a priest who cannot find any sense of fulfillment in his life and sets his sights on Kiritsugu as the possible answer to the emptiness he feels.nn(Source: Wikipedia)', 'n-7PFiut1HI', '2013-02-20 20:33:14', '2016-07-04 03:05:51', 'Fate.zero.full.1064239.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 1868391, '2014-12-17 06:07:28', 4.372978016726629, 32579, 'Violence, Profanity', 1, '2011-10-02', '2011-12-25', 0, 'fat.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 0, 2014, 100, 0, 0, 'en_jp', 'N', 2597767),
